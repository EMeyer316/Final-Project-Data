"Note: The subperiods are measured from cyclical peak to peak in aggregate economic activity. Land is included as part of the capital input in this table. Intermediate goods include feed and seed, energy use, fertilizer and lime, pesticides, purchased services, and other materials use. Labor, capital, and intermediate inputs aggregate across different attributes within each input aggregate (including gender, age, educational attainment and employment types for labor; durable equipment, including autos, tractors, trucks, and other machineries, service buildings, land, and inventories for capital; and feed and seed, energy, fertilizers, pesticides, purchased services, and other materials for intermediate goods). The contribution of an input aggregate to growth reflects changes in the quantity of the aggregate, and changes in the quality (composition of specific components) of the aggregate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
